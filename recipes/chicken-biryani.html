     <h3>Step2</h3>
    <p>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot 
        oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until
         onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring
          constantly, for 5 minutes.</p>

     <h3>Step 4</h3>
     <p>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally,
         until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry
          and starts to stick to the pan.</p>

     <h3>Step 5</h3>
     <p>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes.

          for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.   </p>
