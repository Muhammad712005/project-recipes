        <center><h2>Cooking Process</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Cut chicken into about 1 to 1 1/2 inch pieces;add to the bowl of a food processor. Add breadcrumbs,
         salt, paprica, black pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, and the 1 tablespoon vegetable oil to the food processor, 
         and pulse on and off until mixture is finely ground, but not yet a smooth puree </p>
         <h3>Step 2</h3>
         <p>
            Scoop 2 tablespoon-sized portions onto a sheet pan, making 24 total. cover and chill for about 30 minutes.
             meanwhile, shake self-risisng flour and cornstarch together in a bag, and set aside (if using all-purpose flour,
              add in 1/2 teaspoon baking soda). 
         </p>
         <h3>Step 3</h3>
         <p>Using slightly damp hands, shape each portion into a ball;add 5 or 6 at a time to the flour mixture in the bag. 
            Toss to coat, shake off excess, and place back on the sheet pan. once coated, form each into the nugget shape of your choice.\
            A ball shape works well for deep frying; if pan-frying, a flat nugget works best.
         </p>
         <h3>Step 4</h3>
         <p>Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 to 2 hours, or until ready to fry. Nuggets can be made aday ahead.</p>

             together in a bowl; cover and refrigerate until ready to serve. </p>

        <p>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F(175 degrees C) Deep fry nuggets until no longer pink
            at the center and golden brown on the outside, about 4 minutes, An instant read the thermometer inserted near the center 
            shoul read 165 degrees F(74 degrees C). Alternately, heat oil as needed in a skillet over medium-high heat, and shallow 
            fry until cooked as above, 2 to 3 minutes per sisde.
        </p>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <p> Transfer cooked nuggets to a mixing bowl, and add the sliced green onions. pour in about 1/2 cup sauce, and toss to coat.
            Extra sauce can be served alongside, or used for other applications , as sandwich spread or as a dip.
